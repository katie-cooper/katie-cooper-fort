      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
          Our team is designing a product for our class <strong>BOLD 523: Software Engineering Lab</strong>. We are partnering with our client, <strong>Kris Jordan</strong>, a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at UNC. Our goal is to create an <strong>agentic AI agent</strong> capable of grading students' projects based on a given rubric. This tool will enable teachers to efficiently assign and grade open-ended, creative, and cutting-edge projects, supporting innovative learning experiences in their classes.
