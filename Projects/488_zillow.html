            <h2>Overview & Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                We used data web-scraped from Zillow containing information about homes in Chapel Hill. 
                The dataset included details provided on the Zillow site, such as home age, location, 
                estimated value, and other property characteristics. Our group cleaned and prepared this data, 
                leveraging AI tools to assist in the process, and built a predictive model to identify homes 
                with renovation potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                The model was designed to be useful for contractors in the Chapel Hill area who are looking 
                to identify properties with renovation value. Our presentation included a demonstration of the model, 
                a Figma mockup of the product, and a pitch to stakeholders and potential users of Fixit Finder.
