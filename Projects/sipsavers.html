      <strong>Skills Learned & Experience Gained:</strong> 
      During the hackathon, we attended workshops and worked closely with faculty and technical mentors to enhance our skills in:
      
      <ul>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development</li>
        <li>Figma for UI/UX design and prototyping</li>
        <li>Flutter for mobile app development</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also gained valuable experience presenting our prototype to company representatives at the hackathon demo, improving both our technical and professional communication skills.
