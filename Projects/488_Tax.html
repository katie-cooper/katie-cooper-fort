        SmartTax is an AI-powered chatbot created by Katie Fort at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
        It is designed to assist users with tax-related questions and simplify tax information for young adults 
        and first-time filers. Built with authoritative data sources and enhanced with a supportive interaction 
        model, SmartTax ensures a seamless and less stressful tax filing experience.

        <h2>Overview & Functionality</h2>
        <p>
        SmartTax provides simple and accurate tax-related guidance. While it was initially built with college students 
        and young adults in mind, its functionality extends beyond this demographic, incorporating data on retirement 
        tax benefits, bankruptcy, and more.

        <h2>Technical Skills & Tech Stack</h2>
        <p>
            SmartTax was developed as part of an advanced AI applications course project, requiring the design of a 
            complete AI-driven service with real-world utility. Building this product involved integrating 
            <strong>generative AI</strong>, <strong>retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</strong>, and a 
            <strong>web interface</strong> backed by custom logic and APIs.
