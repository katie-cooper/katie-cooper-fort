            <h2>Technical Skills & Tech Stack</h2>
        <p>
            SmartTax was developed as part of an advanced AI applications course project, requiring the design of a 
            complete AI-driven service with real-world utility. Building this product involved integrating 
            <strong>generative AI</strong>, <strong>retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</strong>, and a 
            <strong>web interface</strong> backed by custom logic and APIs.
