                I’m a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, studying Computer Science, Data Science, and Studio Art. I’m passionate about using large datasets to drive innovative solutions and love creating products with the client in mind throughout the entire development process. With lots of experience in agile development, I prioritize feedback, iteration, and clear communication—whether I’m coding or managing a project.

                As a Studio Arts major, I channel my creativity through ceramics. I enjoy learning new techniques and sharing my progress, and this page is a space where I can showcase that journey.

                I grew up moving around a lot—born in Japan, then living in Beijing, China—but I consider Mercer Island, Washington my hometown. Outside of school, I’m an enthusiastic cook (always on the lookout for new recipes!), learning Japanese on Duolingo (let’s start a streak together!), and love running and exploring the outdoors. I’m a huge fan of hiking in the Pacific Northwest—it’s hard to beat those views!
